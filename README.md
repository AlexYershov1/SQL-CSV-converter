# SQL-CSV-converter
SQL to CSV converter, built using python.

# Name: Alexander Yershov

# The sql file 'demo' is an example of an SQL file. For personal purposes- you may create a different SQL file under the same name, or change the path in the program. 

# build and run the converter and the sql file from the same directory.

# All the csv files will appear in the csvFile folder- a new directory created to store all the files.
